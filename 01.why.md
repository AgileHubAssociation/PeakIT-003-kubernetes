# Why ?!

Does it worth it ?

Product or Company

Complexity Index = Computing power * Disk Space * Scaling needs * Bandwidth

## Why else ?

- Not depending on a 3rd party. White label solutions.
- Extra sensitive information / regulatory control.
- Be safe from the government. Insert -> here <- Conspiracy theory.
- Self healing.
- Test environment.
- Business model: Self-sufficient DevOps team / Simulate Platform-as-a-Service
- Bragging points. Gryffindor: watch out!

## Drawbacks

The team will need to become adept at all the lifecycle management aspects of Kubernetes: standing up clusters, maintaining them, networking, storage and keeping up with releases. In the Kubernetes world, those releases can come every three months. You’ll also be assuming the responsibility, and liability, for keeping the whole thing secure. Managing this all in-house means taking on a significant amount of risk.

A private cloud has private Physical security, which must be thought about.

## Business architecture

The architecture grows with the business, and it is a fine grained balancing act.

- At the begining On-premise can be managed by a single server.
- The middle age or for a specific product is best managed by Cloud environments.
- Scaling to a global product needs both vertical and horizontal scaling.

Horizontal scaling means scaling by adding more machines to your pool of resources (also described as “scaling out”), whereas vertical scaling refers to scaling by adding more power (e.g. CPU, RAM) to an existing machine (also described as “scaling up”.

### Question 3

```
How much power (average load) do you think a HomeLab with 8 physical servers consume ?
upsc Powerware5115
```

### Question 4

```
How much do you think the whole thing cost (hardware) ?
```

## What can Rancher do ?

- Path to 1 Million Clusters – For general availability, the product now supports 2,000 clusters and 100,000 nodes. Additionally, the Rancher 2.4 architecture has been enhanced to provide a path to supporting 1 million clusters in an upcoming release.

- Limited Connectivity Maintenance with K3s – ideal for cluster management, upgrades and patches where clusters may not have fixed or stable network connection, Rancher 2.4 can kick off an upgrade remotely, but the process is managed on local K3s clusters, allowing users to manage upgrades and patches locally and then sync with the management server once connectivity is restored.

- Zero Downtime Maintenance for RKE – As organizations increasingly run production and business-critical applications, they need a non-disruptive way to maintain their Kubernetes infrastructure. Rancher 2.4 enables zero downtime maintenance, allowing organizations to upgrade Kubernetes clusters and nodes without application interruption. Additionally, users can select and configure their upgrade strategy for add-ons so that DNS and Ingress do not experience service disruption.

- Enhanced Security with CIS Benchmark Scanning – Cluster security is paramount to a successful Kubernetes strategy. But, according to recent research conducted by AimPoint, 44 percent of companies had delayed application production due to security concerns around Kubernetes containers. To help address this issue, Rancher 2.4 introduces CIS Scan, which allows users to run ad-hoc security scans of their RKE clusters against 100+ CIS benchmarks published by the Centre for Internet Security and considered the de facto definition of a secure Kubernetes cluster. Users can create custom test configurations and generate reports illustrating pass/fail information from which they can take corrective action to ensure their clusters meet all security requirements.

## Security by design

You can't patch for security.

Immutable infrastructure readiness checklist:

- Infrastructure as code
- Outstanding monitoring for applications and deployments
- Centralize logging
- Tracing
- Deployment automation using immutable deployment pattern (canary)
- Golden image creation and update pipeline
- Processes to assess, decommission, and distribute golden images
- Stateless applications layer
- Beware of temporary, transient state
- Using snapshot for volumes
- Using databases, object or in-memory data-stores for data
- SSH turned off
- No SSH keys on servers

## Conclusion

Every organization is different, and it's impossible to suggest which type of platform is right for your organization. Each company should do a complete study to decide whether to migrate from on-premises to the cloud -- or, alternatively, to take a hybrid approach.
