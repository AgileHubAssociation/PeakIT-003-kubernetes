# Why ?!

Does it worth it ?

Product or Company

Complexity Index = Computing power * Disk Space * Scaling needs * Bandwidth

## Business architecture

The architecture grows with the business, and it is a fine grained balancing act.

- At the begining On-premise can be managed by a single server.
- The middle age or for a specific product is best managed by Cloud environments.
- Scaling to a global product needs both vertical and horizontal scaling.

Horizontal scaling means scaling by adding more machines to your pool of resources (also described as “scaling out”), whereas vertical scaling refers to scaling by adding more power (e.g. CPU, RAM) to an existing machine (also described as “scaling up”.

## Security by design

You can't patch for security.

Immutable infrastructure readiness checklist:

- Infrastructure as code
- Outstanding monitoring for applications and deployments
- Centralize logging
- Tracing
- Deployment automation using immutable deployment pattern (canary)
- Golden image creation and update pipeline
- Processes to assess, decommission, and distribute golden images
- Stateless applications layer
- Beware of temporary, transient state
- Using snapshot for volumes
- Using databases, object or in-memory data-stores for data
- SSH turned off
- No SSH keys on servers
