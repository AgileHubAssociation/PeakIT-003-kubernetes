# Devops02

What it really means to create an on-premise cloud with Kubernetes. PeakIt.003

## What subjects we address in this class:

- Why ?! Does it worth it ?
- Setting up one minimal linux host for a node
- Continous Integration and Continous Deployment
- Kubectl for Dummies
- Rancher orchestrator
- LoadBalancers: Nginx
- Shared persistent data: Nfs
- Cert-manager: Jetstack

### We do not discuss about:

- Visual Studio Code setup not covered in this class
- Not going into Dockerization / Development installation
- Other clusters: Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (Amazon EKS)
- Ansible, Terraform, Puppet or Chef are not in our scope
- Other Loadbalancers: HaProxy, Metallb will not be shown
- Shared persistent data: Longhorn
- Monitoring / Logging / Optimizations are not in our scope

## Surprizes

- We will ask each participant (not really a random order) a simple question
- At the end a fully fledged project will be shown

## Prerequisites

For this guide, you may want to have a minimal Ubuntu LTS installed on all machines. We are using 3 Bare-Metal Servers. You can perform the same deployment on RancherOS, CentOS and any Redhatish OS family in a similar way on any environment.

Public IP(s) and a router / firewall is not optional :)

Coffee and Space, or how Einstein put it: Space-Time. Why ?! For servers of course.

### Question 1

```
What Linux distribution is your favourite ? and why :)
```
